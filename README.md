# Employee_Turnover_Prediction

Employee turnover refers to the percentage of workers who leave an organization and are replaced by new employees. It is very costly for organizations, where costs include but not limited to: separation, vacancy, recruitment, training and replacement. On average, organizations invest between four weeks and three months training new employees. This investment would be a loss for the company if the new employee decided to leave the first year. Furthermore, organizations such as consulting firms would suffer from deterioration in customer satisfaction due to regular changes in Account Reps and/or consultants that would lead to loss of businesses with clients.

In this project, I worked on simulated HR data from kaggle to build a classifier that helps us predict what kind of employees will be more likely to leave given some attributes. Such classifier would help an organization predict employee turnover and be pro-active in helping to solve such costly matter.
